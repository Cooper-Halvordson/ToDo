# ToDo
This project is an html project to locally create a todo list using html, javascript, and IndexedDB.

Since this is using IndexedDB, the list is saved on a per browser basis.  
The list does not carry over from Firefox to Chrome and vice versa.  
As well, using a private browser will not save any tasks once the browser is closed.

There is currently a limit to 260 lists and tasks.
